  This is a backend with routes that have been built out that view, post, update and delete information, CRUD operations. To use this application, you need to first go to the command line in the root of this directory, connect to mysql, then create the database "ecommerce_db". make sure to fill in the .env file with the correct information. Once the database is connected and .env are updated, you can quit out of mysql, run node seeds/index.js, and this will seed the Database.
